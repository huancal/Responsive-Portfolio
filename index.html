                Hello, my name is Huan Nguyen and welcome to the first webpage that I've designed as a student of
                the UCB Full Stack Bootcamp. I'm
                excited to see how this page evolves as I advanced through the bootcamp.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Shifting the focus on my background, I'll say that being in this bootcamp has brought back nostalgic
                memories for me. I went to UC Berkeley for my undergraduate studies and left with a degree in
                Biology. Since then I've had industry experience in the biotech scope working as a lab technician to
                my current position as hardware automation engineer. My love for programming languages stemmed from
                my experience working as a automation engineer where I had to qualify, validate and program robotic
                liquid handlers. Ultimately my goal from this bootcamp is to acquire the skills to transition my career
                to a software focused engineer.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                During my spare time, I like to dabble in baking and recreating some of my favorite desserts such as ice
                cream and fluffy cheesecake. Aside from food, I'm an avid snow boarder and follower of sports. As a Bay
                Area Native, I naturally root for the Dubs and Niners. Please reach out to me and network, I'd love to
                chat about programming languages, food, snowboarding and sports.
